# OOP-Concept

Company ABC recruits employees based on their interview results, UG and
PG results, and other criteria. Two different teams are involved in this
process, namely the recruiting and HR teams. The recruit team checks the
criteria of candidates, conducts an interview, and calculates their final
marks. Finally, the HR team will get all the final results of the evaluation and
inform the candidates of the results.
